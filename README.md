I've taken a few of these Myers-Briggs style tests for classes in the past, and usually I end up getting something like INTJ. A lot of it might just be the Barnum effect, but I like the results I got. When I'm on my own I'm happy, but I love being in a group too - and I do like to make sure the group is running smoothly. During the Galvanize Data Science Immersive there were a few people who didn't have a super strong technical background, and sometimes they struggled. I did my best to help them out.

### Free Response Question:

(That last paragraph ran long, and then I realized it's not a bad way of responding to the free response question.)
This was especially apparent during the real world case studies, when we were broken up into groups of 3-4 and given a limited amount of time to solve a tricky problem with messy data. During the first case study I don't think any of us were really prepared, and I feel like I missed an opportunity to involve a group member who spent a lot of time not being sure what to do. He wasn't stupid - no one in our cohort was - just quiet, not pushy enough to ask for help or something to do because we were all frantically working on our own pieces of the problem. When I was paired with him and another student for another case study, later in the Immersive, I suggested we do our work at the pair-programming stations so he could be more involved.
That makes it seem like I like to be in charge, but that's not exactly it. I don't mind leading when I'm the right fit, and I think I'm at least an alright leader, but what I'm really best at is noticing when someone needs some help, or for someone to speak up for them.
